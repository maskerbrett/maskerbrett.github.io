        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (or beef, pork, seafood, tofu, or vegetables)</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>2 carrots</li>
          <li>2 onions</li>
          <li>1-2 potatoes</li>
          <li>½ Tbsp. ginger</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
          <li>1½ Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
          <li>1 QT (4 cups/1000ml) chicken broth (or water if you use store bought curry roux)</li>
          <li>1 apple (I used Fuji apple)</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp. honey</li>
          <li>2 tsp. salt</li>
          <li>Homemade Japanese curry roux or 1 box (7 oz, 200g) store bought Japanese curry roux</li>
          <li>1½ Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp. ketchup</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Toppings</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Soft boiled egg</li>
          <li>Fukujinzuke (pickles)</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Rinse the chicken and pat dry with paper towel. Discard the extra fat and cut it into bite size pieces. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>Peel and cut the carrot in rolling wedges (Rangiri) and cut the onions in wedges.</li>
          <li>Cut the potatoes into 1.5 inch pieces and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
          <li>Grate the ginger and crush the garlic.</li>
          <li>Heat 1½ Tbsp vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the onions until they become translucent.</li>
          <li>Add the ginger and garlic.</li>
          <li>Add the chicken and cook until the chicken changes color.</li>
          <li>Add the carrot and mix.</li>
          <li>Add the chicken broth (or water).</li>
          <li>Bring the stock to boil and skim the scrum and fat from the surface of the stock.</li>
          <li>Peel the apple and coarsely grate the apples.</li>
          <li>Add the honey and salt and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender, and turn off the heat. Meanwhile you can make homemade curry roux.</li>
          <li>When the potatoes are ready, add the curry. If you use the store-bought curry roux, put 1-2 blocks of roux in a ladle and slowly let it dissolve with spoon or chopsticks. Continue with the rest of blocks. Then go to Step #17.</li>
          <li>If you are using homemade curry roux, add a ladleful or two of cooking liquid from the stock and mix into the curry paste. Add more cooking liquid if necessary and mix well until it’s smooth.</li>
          <li>Add the roux paste back into the stock in the large pot and stir to combine.</li>
          <li>Add soy sauce and ketchup. Simmer uncovered on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the curry becomes thick.</li>
          <li>Serve the curry with Japanese rice on the side and garnish with soft boiled egg and Fukujinzuke. You can store the curry in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days and in the freezer for 1 month. Potatoes will change the texture so you can take them out before freezing.</li>
